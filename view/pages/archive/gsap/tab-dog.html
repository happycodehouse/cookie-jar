                THE DOG, the brand for <br>
                the society and our daily lives.
            </h3>

            <p>
                In 2000, THE DOG was created with the unique images and perspectives captured and made possible using a
                fisheye lens.
                <br>
                Since then, THE DOG’s images and related character goods have been distributed in more than 50
                countries,
                <br>
                and is now a recognizable iconic character well-loved by fans all over the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ushering in our 20th anniversary, THE DOG has undergone some revamps in our branding, <br>
                to keep THE DOG relevant and in touch with the latest trends and needs, <br>
                while staying true to our roots and the familiarity of our unique characters.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, SAVE THE DOG PROJECT was also established and created to assist and <br>
                support the activities of the various animal rescue organizations and animal shelters,
                <br>
                by committing a portion of our revenue to them through donations.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the mindset of providing and contributing back to the society through our business, <br>
                we aim to pursue our mission to create a sustainable contribution system through the growth and
                expansion of our business, <br>
                and strive to be a brand that will play an important role in our society and daily lives.

                "SAVE THE DOG PROJECT" is a project that <br>
                donates a portion of its profits <br>
                to conservation efforts
            </h3>
            <p>
                The SAVE THE DOG PROJECT is a project launched by THE DOG COMPANY to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the birth of THE DOG, with the aim of solving various problems related to dogs and cats.
                <br>
                A portion of the sales related to the THE DOG brand business is donated to DOG EAR FUNDS, an NPO animal welfare organization.
                <br><br>
                What can we do to save the lives of unfortunate dogs and cats? Many people may have the desire to do so, but are unable to take action such as donating. <br>
                We have introduced a system that allows those who have never had the opportunity to "donate" before to participate in donations easily and without burden through shopping.
                <br><br>
                By continuing to accumulate these small efforts, we believe that there will be a future in 30, 50, or 100 years from now where people and beloved dogs and cats live together happily, and we aim for THE DOG to exist to support that lifestyle.

                                        FSCⓇ certification is an international forest certification system that identifies products made from forests that are managed responsibly in an environmentally sound, socially beneficial, and economically sustainable manner, as well as forest products produced there, renewable resources, and other raw materials from controlled sources. It means that raw materials are used from certified forests that are "properly managed" and meet international standards supported by stakeholders in the environmental, social, and economic fields, and that originate from sources with low social and environmental risks. Choosing products with the FSCⓇ mark helps us to value forests.
